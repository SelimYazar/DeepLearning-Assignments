# DeepLearning-Assignments

Homework 1: Image Processing with OpenCV and Visualization
Model: Image transformation and visualization techniques using OpenCV, matplotlib, and numpy
Description: This assignment covers various image processing tasks, including color space transformations (RGB, HSV, Lab), resizing, and visualizing multiple color channels of a single image.

Homework 2: Image Feature Extraction and k-NN Classification
Model: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier
Description: The task focuses on extracting statistical features from images (camera, flamingo, pizza) and using the k-NN algorithm for classification, evaluating accuracy and performance across multiple classes.

Homework 3: Data Preprocessing and Perceptron Model Training
Model: Perceptron model
Description: This task involves loading a dataset, performing preprocessing (resizing, feature extraction), and training a perceptron model to classify images. Performance metrics and model evaluation methods are also discussed.

Homework 4: Convolutional Neural Network with Gish Activation Function
Model: CNN with Gish activation function
Description: The assignment explores training a CNN model with a Gish activation function for image classification using the Caltech Tiny dataset. It includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and F1 score.

Homework 5: Spam Email Classification with LSTM
Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
Description: This task covers the training of an LSTM model to classify emails as spam or non-spam, using data preprocessing, vectorization techniques, and evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, F1 score, and accuracy.
